This is a parallel version of the 1-D Energy Balance Model modified to include the Greenhouse Effect for Earth-like planets. It finds and uses all of the available cores. (Compatible with the Slurm workload manager)

This version calculates the fraction of the year the planet's surface is thawed at varying eccentricities, obliquities and SED as well as the edge of the Runway Green House (RGH)^M

The code outputs results in an eccentricity vs. installation array in the .csv format
